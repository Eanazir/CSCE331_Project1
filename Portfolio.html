            <h1> Quadcopter Drone project </h1>
            </br>
            This project is still an ongoing project that me and my friends have been trying to develop for some time.
            The challenge we set ahead of ourselves was to build a functioning drone with minimal reliance on
            third-party materials. This meant that we would try to design and 3D print the chassis, customizing our own motor,
            integrating the electrical components, and of course write the code that drives it all. The team consisted
            to Mechanical, Electrical, and Computer Engineering students. I took the lead in managing a lot of the
            code-related aspects and set goals for myself. From the Project's start, I was particularly interested on diving deeper
            into machine learning, so i took the chance and set a goal to try to develop an algorithm that would enable the
            drone to avoid hitting large immovable obstacles. I had to then think about how to electrically attach the Flight
            Controller, which is the brain of the drone, managing stabilization and flight dynamics. It usually includes
            an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to sense orientation and acceleration.

            During this project me and my teammates attempted to tackle one of the
            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx">14 Grand Challenges</a>
            for Engineering. These challenges are outlined by the NAE (National Academy of Engineering).
            The challenge we attempted to tackle was Engineering the Tools of Scientific Discovery", where in the
            century ahead scientists as well as engineers will need to further their understanding of the
            many unanswered questions of nature. We developed a program that aims to improve the success rate
            of launching and maintaining satellites by using data to identify points of failure in the satellites.
            Furthermore, our program allows us to balance the cost to performance ratio in the process and to
            decrease the space debris by providing the optimal conditions in orbit.

                <h1> Mini Traffic Light </h1>
                </br>
                In this simple project I used a Raspberry Pi as the micro-controller to develop and control the
                Logic behind building a miniature traffic light along with a pedestrian signal. For this project,
                I did things in two different ways. First, we kept polling every 0.01 seconds to see if a button
                was pressed. The second approach was a bit fancier - I used interrupts. This was done to demonstrate
                the difference between the two and in most cases using interrupts would be more accurate and less
                computationally demanding. One of the constraints was to not register any clicks with in 20s of
                the previous click. The LED did not have a yellow color so it was represented with Blue.
